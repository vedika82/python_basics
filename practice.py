# we are using pythin3 for work
import sys
print (sys.version)
# from this we know that we are using python3 version
# sys is a built in module that contains many system syspecific parameters and functions 
# here python is an interpreted language which means it tells error during the writing of the code i.e line by line execution of the code and not after the whole code is written and compiled
# and not during the compilation like most of the languages do

# example
# print("This will be printed")
# frint("This will cause an error")
# print("This will NOT be printed")
